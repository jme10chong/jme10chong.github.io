# __"Shapeless Sounds"__

## Project Description

"Shapeless Sounds" is an audio-interactive web sketch that is inspired by glitch music and visuals. The shape drawn makes use of the super shapes formula derived by Paul Bourke, which gives us 6 variables: 'm', 'a', 'b', 'n1', 'n2', and 'n3', that can changed individually to create unique shapes.

A variety of glitch-style audio tracks are available to the user through a graphic user interface. The sketch interprets the resulting audio data to animate or draw shapes drawn onto the window canvas. The audio data is then interpreted using the fast fourier transform (fft) algorithm.

Using the super shapes formula in conjunction with the fft algorithm, we can map our audio information to change the size, shape, speed, resolution, and color, of the resulting shape drawn on the window canvas, as demonstrated in the various sketches.

## Reflection

I first came across the super shape formula when looking through a Coding Train tutorial, and was immediately drawn to the number of shapes that I could draw by simply changing any of the 6 variables used in the formula.

When I started working on my final project, I knew I wanted to do something related to super shapes. However, one of the main problems I faced is that my sketches were too similar to one another, as the super shape as a very distinct pattern and shape to it. In the end, I decided to focus on the following 3 elements: shape, texture and movement, in order to create 3 unique sketches that fully explores the capabilities of super shape formula in their respective elements.

Another problem I encounter was the website design, as I had trouble figuring out how to best present my sketches online. I opted to go for a minimalistic approach, with a black & white colour palette and as little text as possible. Interestingly enough, I found it quite challenging to adopt this approach, as it was difficult to choose the right fonts and colours that would aesthetically appealing to the viewer.

The road to the final sketch was a long and tough one, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience working with p5, javascript and html, and am looking forward to trying other software in the future!
